# 2048Gremlins

Merging 2048 and Gremlins.js = Let the gremlins do the job :-) 

Just for the fun, because I like Gabriele Cirulli work and I wanted to try the Marmelab lib gremlins.js, I mixed all those stuff.

- The [Demo is here](http://github.hamdouni.com/2048Gremlins/) : Be carefull, it only works on Firefox ! Sorry webkit browser does not allow firing key events (or I still don't find how :-) )
- [Original 2048](https://github.com/gabrielecirulli/2048)
- [Original Gremlins.js](https://github.com/marmelab/gremlins.js)

## How to use it

Open index.html in Firefox and see the gremlins play. 

## How to build gremlins.min.js

use [r.js](https://github.com/jrburke/r.js)

	cd build
	r.js -o build.js

It automaticaly builds the minified gremlins js and put it in js/ folder.
